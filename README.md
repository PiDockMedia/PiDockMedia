# PiDockMedia

Bzz Bzz Bzzz....zowie! Is this thing on?

This project burst out of the need for a media serving solution that was flexible, easy to set up, easy to maintain, and easy to fix while remain9ing flexible and relatively highly available. Windows media server, iTunes, FreeNAS, OMV, Folders, XBMC, Linux, Plex, Emby, etc were all various usable solutions that never lasted more then 2 years. Netflix with streaming? DVDs and everything in one place? Yes! ....uh....why are there so many services? This is as bad as cable TV. This robot needed something better!
