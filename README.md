# PiDockMedia

Bzz Bzz Bzzz....zowie! Is this thing on?

This project burst out of the need for a media serving solution that was flexible, easy to set up, easy to maintain, and easy to fix while remaining flexible and relatively highly available. Windows media server, iTunes, FreeNAS, OMV, Folders, XBMC, Linux, Plex, Emby, etc were all various usable solutions that never lasted more than 2 years.
